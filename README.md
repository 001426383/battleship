Python Open Project - pygame_battleship
===========================

This is a project powered by Codecademy students.

Project 1: Battleship

For this project we'll be using the pygame framework wich is basically
a module made for making python games for windows/mac/linux/etc.

If you want to be part of it just do it, you'll need (of course) to have <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/">python</a> downloaded (version 2.7.3 please) and
once installed, download and install <a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">pygame</a> (also for version 2.7).

If you're not related to the pygame framework, here are some tutorials:
